# cargo-package-code

Working with a package that has bad documentation or just lazy?
This package allows you to search Github for repositories that use a certain cargo package,
hopefully allowing you to borrow some code.

## Todo
- [x] Improve console output
- [ ] Stars/Forks/Code requirements
- [ ] Multiple packages in one repo?
